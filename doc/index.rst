Welcome to ubd's documentation!
===============================

ubd (Ugly By Design) is a small GUI framework with a very specific goal:

 *To make it easy to create and use quick and ugly GUIs*

TODO Flashy code example

TODO Features (when they are implemented). Minimalistic design tool, universal API, property style
access, templates, non OO entry.

The purpose is to make it easier and more accessible for
non-proffessional programmers like etc. scientists to create GUI's for
e.g. data acquisition programs, without the burden of having to learn
full fleshed GUI design tools and without having to get familiar with
large GUI framework API's.
